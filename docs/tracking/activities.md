# Activities Tracking

This is where your daily time tracking takes place. Use it as a live dashboard to record your ongoing work and get a quick overview about the past days.

## Activities bar

To start tracking time, proceed from left to right and start by selecting a **customer**. Next, choose a **project** and **task** you want to track time for.
Ideally, add a **comment** to describe the ongoing work.
You can start tracking with the **play button** and stop it with the **same button**. Once you begin an **activity**, it will appear in the **activities tab** below.
You can also resume any task from this tab by clicking the respective play button at the end of its row.

**Note:** Newly created tasks won't be included in your working hours by solely toggling the play/stop button. For finalizing the time tracking you have to click `Generate timesheet` in the top right of the **activities tab**.
This will summarize similar task of the day and create entries in your **timesheet tab**.

## Overview Benchmark

In the middle of your tracking view, use the overview component to switch between days and review your logged hours.

On the right, you'll find a navigation toolbar that helps you to jump back to today or navigate via calendar. The button with the wand icon [magic link](/docs/details/magic_link) let's you generate links to a specific task.
