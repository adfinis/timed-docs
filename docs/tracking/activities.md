# Activities Tracking

This is the place your day to day time tracking takes place. It should be used as a live dashboard, where you can record your ongoing work and get a quick overview about the past days.

To start a time tracking we go from left to right and start by selecting a customer. Further you need to choose a project and a task you want to start a time tracking for.
Ideally you add a comment for the ongoing work as well.
You can start the tracking with the play button and stop the record with the same button. After you starting a task it will pop up in the activities tab underneath.
You can resume any task from there as well, by just clicking the respective play button at the end of the row.

Note: The tasks that you've just created won't be included in your working time by solely toggling the play/stop button. For finilizing the time tracking you have to click `Generate timesheet` in the top right of the activities tab.
This will summarize similar task of the day and create entries in your _timesheet_ tab.
