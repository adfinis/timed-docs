# Remaining Effort

For some projects staying on track with both budget and deadlines is critical. Project managers need to continuously assess:

- **Budget vs. Remaining Effort** – Is the remaining budget sufficient to complete the project?
- **Time vs. Remaining Effort** – Can the project be finished within the available time before the deadline?

To avoid manual tracking in spreadsheets, Remaining Effort Tracking provides an always up-to-date estimate of how much effort is still needed, based on input from team members.

## Activating Remaining Effort Tracking

Since not all projects require this level of tracking, it can be enabled or disabled per project:

1. Navigate to the **"Projects"** page.
2. Select the relevant project.
3. Find the **"Remaining Effort Tracking"** option.
4. Toggle the setting to enable or disable tracking (default: disabled).
5. Click the **"Update"** button to confirm the setting change.

Once enabled, users will see an additional input field when logging time, allowing them to enter an estimate of how much effort remains for their task.

## How It Works

### Entering Remaining Effort

When logging time on a Timed Task, an extra field will appear next to the standard time entry. Users should:

- Enter how much effort is still needed to complete the task.
- Update the estimate as the work progresses.

**Note:** When multiple users work on the same task, the **most recent update** to the remaining effort field will override any previous entries. To ensure accuracy, team members should coordinate and update the field carefully to reflect the latest estimate.

### Viewing Remaining Effort Estimates

The system automatically calculates total remaining effort and displays it in key areas:

- **Project Tooltips** – Shows a summary of the remaining effort for the entire project.

- **Task Tooltips** – Displays remaining effort for specific tasks.

These estimates update dynamically whenever a team member modifies their input.

### Insights on the Statistics Page

The Statistics page offers a visual breakdown of project progress:

- **Budget (red dashed line)** – Indicates the project's financial limit.
- **Spent Time (blue bar)** – Tracks logged hours.
- **Remaining Effort Estimate (shallow red or green bar)** – Shows how much work is still required.

This view helps PMs quickly assess whether a project is within budget or at risk of overruns.

## Why Use This Feature?

- **Proactive Budget Control** – Catch potential budget issues early and take corrective action.
- **No More Spreadsheet Updates** – Keep estimates up to date directly within the system.
- **Improved Transparency** – Team members and stakeholders can easily see if a project is on track without needing to ask the PM.

By integrating remaining effort tracking into the workflow, project management becomes more efficient, transparent, and proactive.
